    "text": "Why Programming or Coding?\nThere are a lot of fancy answers to it. But the key idea is that you want to be lazy about repetitive tasks (MBAs call it being “productive”).\nMany tasks - data cleaning, wrangling, visualization, and statistical analysis - require you to do them many times. Moreover, you would want to be able to reproduce and replicate your thinking about all of the tasks mentioned above on many different datasets and sometimes even on the same dataset after some time.\nCoding is about formalizing your thinking about how you treat the data and automating the formalization task to be done repetitively. It improves efficiency, enhances reproducibility, and boosts creativity when it comes to finding new patterns in your data.\nGuidelines for data and statistical analyses:1\n\nAccuracy: Write a code that reduces the chances of making an error and lets you catch one if it occurs.\nEfficiency: If you are doing it twice, see the pattern of your decision-making and formalize it in your code. Difference between Excel and coding\nReplicate-and-Reproduce: Ability to repeat the computational process which reflects your thinking and decisions that you took along the way. Improves transparency and forces one to be deliberate and responsible about choices during analyses.\n\nHuman Interpretability: Writing code is not just about analyzing but allowing yourself and then others to be able to understand your analytic choices.\n\nPublic Good: Research is a public good. And the code allows your research to be truly accessible. This means you write a code that anyone else who understands the language can read, reuse, and recreate without you being present. We essentially ensure that by writing a readable and ideally publicly accessible code.",

    "text": "R and RStudio\nR is a free open-source statistical programming language. We generally use R through RStudio which is an integrated development environment (IDE). Essentially, it is the graphic user interface that allows us to use R efficiently. It has point-and-click functionality also (which we would not use a lot).\n\n\n\n\n\nRStudio Screen\n\n\n\n\nR Scripts: This is where put your code in a script. The script is saved with a .R extension. An R script is a text file that you can read on text editors too. We use RStudio to run the code in a way that the computer understands.\nConsole: Output from your code appears here. You can also write the code directly here. But it does not get saved. Also, by default, it shows only a limited number of previous steps (commands + outputs). Not a good practice to code here.\nEnvironment: All the objects, datasets, lists, etc that you have created/loaded in the environment appear here. Alongside, you also see the custom functions that you might create.\nFile Browser/Help/Plot: Internal file navigator and help documentation for packages and functions appear here. Further, when you plot anything, that also gets shown here.\nComments: R interprets every line in the script as a separate command. And it does for each line unless preceded by a #. Comments signal to R that what follows the # is to be ignored.We use comments to write explanatory notes about the code. A comment should explain the purpose of a command or code and not just be a description of what it does.",

They tell R where to operate from.\nWorking directories are specified using a file path i.e. the address in your computer where your script will be stored, or where your dataset is kept.\n\n# Commands:\ngetwd() # Gets the present directory or pathway where you are operating from\n     \nsetwd(\"&lt;press tab here&gt;\") # Setting new directory as working directory\n\nlist.files()  #list the files in the working directory\n\nBelow is a limited list of commands for loading/importing most commonly used dataset types.\n\nread.csv(\"FileName\") # reads CSV files / press tab inside the quotes\nread_csv(\"Pathname/filename.csv\")  \n\n# The part before :: in the following code refers to the package from where the \n#  function comes from.

    "text": "WTH is \\(\\LaTeX\\)?\n\\(\\LaTeX\\) (pronounced “LAY-tek” or “LAH-Tek) is a typesetting tool for preparing high-quality professional documents. It is the preferred typesetting tool used in high-end scientific documentation task. Essentially, it allows you better control over how your document look like, has enhanced capabilities to write technical specifications (Maths, stats, proofs, etc.), and produces readily editable back-end documents.\nIt is not a word-processing tool. It is a simple tool without too many priors about how the document should look like.\nIn academic world there are definite advantages to learning and being comfortable with \\(\\LaTeX\\). That would require regular use and best time to start doing that would be today (or at least next week!).\nThere are many interfaces that allow you to work with \\(\\LaTeX\\). Overleaf is a widely used online platform and Texmaker is a popular offline application.\nHowever, RStudio has in-built capability to double as a \\(\\LaTeX\\) editor. Previously RMarkdown and now Quarto are those capabilities that you can harness to achieve professional and beautifully typeset documents.\nThink of writing an equation like:\n\\[\nViolence_{i,j} = \\beta_0 + \\beta_1EthnicFractionalization_i + \\gamma_j + \\epsilon_i\n\\] In Latex, using quarto, you have to write something like the following:\n$Violence_{i,j} = \\\\beta_0 + \\\\beta_1EthnicFractionalization_i + \\\\gamma_j + \\\\epsilon_i$\nFor a single line of text we encapsulate code by $ sign.\nFor multi-line code we use $$.\nRead more about \\(\\LaTeX\\) here\nThe box folder has some detailed resources for helping with typesetting in \\(\\LaTeX\\).",

Literate statistical programming, as Donald Knuth (1984) defines, is a way to write programs that focuses on explaining to human readers what we want the computers to do, rather than just instructing the computers to do so.\nQuarto can include code from not just R, but also Python, Julia, Stata and many other languages/tools.\nQuarto allows you to truly include the good coding guidelines that we discussed on day 1. It provides you with capability to write code using R, write text that is part of any professional communication, and include mathematical symbols and equations in a well typeset format. Essentially, it allows you to work on a manuscript with data analysis at one place.\nHere is some cool stuff that you can do with quarto.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nRun the following in console:\n```{r}\ninstall.packages(\"tinytex\")\n\ntinytex::install_tinytex()`. \n\n```\nThis installs the latex distribution that Rmarkdown and Quarto readily work with for generating PDF output.\nMore details and troubleshooting here and here.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExercise 1\n\nOpen a new quarto document by File &gt; New File &gt; Quarto Document.\nUse Render button on top on scripts panel to save and get a .pdf output.",

You can edit this file in two ways: Programmatically by being in source button and visually by choosing the Visual button, both button on top left corner of the .qmd window.

More on code chunk options here\nOptions available for customizing output include:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOption\nDescription\n\n\n\n\neval\nEvaluate the code chunk (if false, just echos the code into the output).\n\n\necho\nInclude the source code in output\n\n\noutput\nInclude the results of executing the code in the output (true, false, or asis to indicate that the output is raw markdown and should not have any of Quarto’s standard enclosing markdown).\n\n\nwarning\nInclude warnings in the output.\n\n\nerror\nInclude errors in the output (note that this implies that errors executing code will not halt processing of the document).\n\n\ninclude\nCatch all for preventing any output (code or results) from being included (e.g. include: false suppresses all output from the code block).\n\n\n\nYou can also add these options as global options in the YAML by writing them under execute option like:\n---\nexecute: \n  echo: true\n  inlcude: false\n---\nThe following table summarizes which types of output each option suppresses:1\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOption\nRun code\nShow code\nOutput\nPlots\nMessages\nWarnings\n\n\n\n\neval: false\nX\n\nX\nX\nX\nX\n\n\ninclude: false\n\nX\nX\nX\nX\nX\n\n\necho: false\n\nX\n\n\n\n\n\n\nresults: hide\n\n\nX\n\n\n\n\n\nfig-show: hide\n\n\n\nX\n\n\n\n\nmessage: false\n\n\n\n\nX\n\n\n\nwarning: false\n\n\n\n\n\nX\n\n\n\n\nInline code\nWe can also embed R code into a Quarto document: directly into the text, with: ```{r} &lt;code&gt; ```.\nFor example: ```{r} (2+2)```.\n\n\n\nMarkdown Text\nMarkdown text is like any other text just with some special considerations.\nYou can see the help section from R to see some of the basic formatting tips.\n\n\n\nR Markdown Help\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThese are some of the regularly used formatting options in RMarkdown/Quarto Titles and subtitles ————————————————————\n# Title 1\n\n## Title 2\n\n### Title 3\n\n\nText formatting \n------------------------------------------------------------\n\n*italic*  \n\n**bold**   \n\n`code`\n\nLists\n------------------------------------------------------------\n\n* Bulleted list item 1\n* Item 2\n  * Item 2a\n  * Item 2b\n\n1.

    "text": "File Management and Workflow\n\nUnderstanding Absolute and Relative Paths\nWhen working with files in any programming environment, paths specify the location of files and folders. These paths can be absolute or relative, and the choice between them significantly impacts reproducibility, portability, and ease of collaboration\nAbsolute Paths An absolute path provides the complete address of a file or folder, starting from the root directory of the file system. It tells the software exactly where to find a file, regardless of where the script is run.\nExample: C:/Users/YourName/Documents/Project/Data/raw_data.dta\nRelative Paths A relative path specifies the location of a file or folder relative to a “base directory” (e.g., the project’s working directory). It does not start from the root directory but instead is calculated based on the location of the script.\nSuppose your working directory is set to: C:/Users/YourName/Documents/Project\nThen, a relative path might look like: Data/raw_data.dta\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPractical Analogy Think of absolute and relative paths like giving directions to a house:\nAbsolute Path: “Go to the main city square, then take the highway north, turn right at the first traffic light, and find the house at 123 Main Street.” Works for people starting anywhere, but requires detailed instructions specific to the city. Relative Path: “From the library, walk two blocks north, then turn left. The house is the second one on the right.” Simpler and context-aware, but assumes everyone starts from the library.\n\n\n\nKey Differences Between Absolute and Relative Paths\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFeature\nAbsolute Path\nRelative Path\n\n\n\n\nStarting Point\nStarts from the root directory of the file system.\nStarts from the current working directory.\n\n\nPortability\nNot portable—specific to the user’s system.\nHighly portable—adapts to different systems.\n\n\nEase of Sharing\nHarder to share; others must update paths.\nEasier to share; no changes needed if structure is consistent.\n\n\nUse Case\nBest for fixed environments or one-off scripts.\nIdeal for collaborative and reproducible projects.\n\n\nFlexibility\nBreaks if the file is moved or the system changes.\nAdapts as long as the folder structure remains consistent.",

    "text": "R Projects\nWe used the setwd() command till now to trace the files we need in our work. As your work expands, projects will have multiple datasets to be loaded, different subsidiary scripts to be used, and multiple outputs to be saved.\nA first order problem related to both file management and reproducability of code is the usage of file paths. Using absolute paths, like ~/User/MyName/Documents/..... becomes cumbersome and also inhibits efficiency of reproducability. Every time someone else runs the script, they will have to change the file paths in all the instances in Rscripts or .qmd file to locate the related datasets as well as other objects. Similarly, there would be issues with saving objects in new places. A partially efficient way we used till now involved using setwd() to direct R to a new working directory; this is also called usage of relative paths\nR Projects is a built-in mechanism in RStudio for seamless file management and usage of relative paths.\nLet’s start by creating a new project. Click File &gt; New Project. Name the new project govt-8001-dataessay.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1: To create new project: (top) first click New Directory, then (middle) click New Project, then (bottom) fill in the directory (project) name, choose a good subdirectory for its home and click Create Project. source\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExercise\n\nDo this process again, this time creating a new project in the the existing directory. The existing directory should be the folder where you have been saving R scripts and .qmd file associated with math camp 2024.\nGo to the folder on your system, and click the .RProj file.\nStart a new qmd file like we did yesterday. Delete existing code except for YAML. Run getwd() command in console and see the difference.\nStart a new R code chunk (cmd + option + I) and load vdem dataset. Notice the change in behavior when you press TAB inside the readRDS() function.\n\n\n\n\n\nStandardized Folder and File Structure (here package)\nAn efficient file and folder management system is going to be crucial as we move into working with serious projects. Storing using all the files associated with a project in a comprehensible folder system is facilitated in both R and Stata. You would ideally want to create your own template for folder management that you follow across projects.\nAn efficient file and folder management system is going to be crucial as we move into working with serious projects. As stressed earlier, keeping and using all the files associated with a project in a comprehensible folder system is facilitated by R Projects. You would ideally want to create your own template for folder management that you follow across proejcts. For starters, the folder structure below is the one created for your data essay assignment in Govt 8001 or Quant 1.\nYou can use the point-and-click fucntionality in your computers to create this structure. Later today, we will briefly go through an R script that do this programmatically.\n📦 govt-8001-dataessay\n├─ govt-8001-dataessay.RProj\n├─ 000-setup.R\n├─ 001-eda.qmd\n├─ 002-analysis.qmd\n└─ 003-manuscript.qmd\n├─ Data\n│  ├─ Raw\n│  │  ├─ Dataset1\n│  │  │  ├─ dataset1.csv\n│  │  │  └─ codebook-dataset1.pdf\n│  │  └─ Dataset2\n│  │     ├─ ...dta\n│  │     └─ codebook-dataset2.pdf\n│  └─ Clean\n│     └─ Merged-df1-df2.csv\n├─ Scripts\n│  ├─ R-scripts\n│  │  ├─ plotting-some-variable.R\n│  │  └─ exploring-different-models.R\n│  ├─ Stata-Scripts\n│  │  └─ seeing-variable-labels.do\n│  └─ Python-Scripts\n│     └─ scraping-data-from-website.py\n└─ Outputs\n   ├─ Plots\n   │  ├─ ...jpeg\n   │  └─ ...png\n   ├─ Tables\n   │  └─ .csv\n   └─ Text\n      └─ ...txt\nSuggested folder structure for a Quant-1 project\nWhile we learnt how to create or associate an .RProj with a folder, integrating it with here() function from the here package, makes things further smoother. Let’s do it with the following exercise.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExercise\n\nGo the RStudio window with mathcamp2024 project.

Ideally, govt-&lt;coursecode&gt;-&lt;project&gt;.\nStart RStudio.\nCreate a new Rstudio Project by clicking File &gt; New Project. Name it govt-&lt;coursecode&gt;-&lt;project.\nCheck if now your RStudio Window shows the project name on top right corner. If not, go to folder and double-click the .RProj file.\nPaste the 000-setup.R file in the main project folder. Open it in the same Rstudio window with the project and run the complete file. Your folder structure is created.\nCopy your raw data in Data/Raw folder. Similarly, your scripts in Scripts/RScripts folder\nStart your new .qmd file and save it in the main folder.\nRemember to use here() package extensively in both scripts and quarto file when loading or saving the data.\nYou can always zip the whole project folder for sharing. The receiver will just need to unzip and run the code after starting the associated .RProj file, without changing file paths on their computer.\n\n\n\n\n\nSandve, Geir Kjetil, Anton Nekrutenko, James Taylor, and Eivind Hovig. 2013. “Ten Simple Rules for Reproducible Computational Research.” PLOS Computational Biology 9 (10): e1003285. https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003285.",
